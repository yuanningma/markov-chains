# markov-chains
Random name generator based on markov chains. Takes in a file destination with a list of names, spits out several randomly generated names based on it. Based on code at https://donjon.bin.sh/

Based on Markov chains, this generator reads through the list of names provided as a base and generates probabilities of moving to each
letter from each other letter to generate realistic-sounding names.
